virtual memory is required: 

    - allow multiple programs to run together safely and efficiently. compile each program into its own address space - range of memory locations only available to the program. virtual memory translates address space to physical addresses. this protects a processes address space. 

    - allow a single program to exceed the size of the physical memory.it frees up the programmer from the drudgery of decides which sections of the program should be loaded and which removed.

page fault: virtual memory miss

virtual addresses are converted to physical addresses using a combination of hardware and software techniques. this is called address translation. keep in mind that a virtual address maybe mapped toa disk address.  

virtual address is broken into virtual memory page number and a page offset.
