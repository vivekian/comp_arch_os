- How does the shell launch a process? 
    * Look internally for shell commands to execute. 
    * If not found then search for binaries in the PATH variable 
    * Once the binary is found with the entire path, then load and execute the binary. 

- Creation of a new process 
    * Shell process clones itself and copies itself in memory.
    * This allows the env variables to be inherited by the new process. 
    * Kernel zeroes out the memory map (except for the env variables) 
    * Next, loader fills in the details of the process from the binary file. 

- What is the role of the kernel? 
    * Kernel executes exec family of functions to launch the process
        - sys_execve() does this. 
        - next, binary format is idenetified (load_elf_binary() is called) 

- What is the role of the loader? 
    * The loaders role is to simply group the sections created by the linker and copy these segments
      to the process memory map
