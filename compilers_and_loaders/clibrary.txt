C library has 4 components: 
    libc: primary component, to open, close, read/write files, printf etc. 
    libm: math functions 
    libpthread: pthread related functionality
    librt: real time extensions to POSIX - shared memory and asynchronous I/O. 

libc is linked by default, but others need to be linked by -lxxx.
