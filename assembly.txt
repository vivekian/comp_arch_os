Caller saved registers: 
    - Caller must save these registers and restore them 
    - e.g. 
        void foo() 
        { 
            # save r4
            goo();
            # restore r4
        } 

        void goo()
        {
            # use r4 here without worrying. 
        } 

    - Callee (goo()) is free to use them. foo() Caller's responsibility. 


What are callee save registers? 
    - Callee must save/restore these registers when it uses them 
    â€“ Caller expects callee to not change them
    
    e.g. 
    void foo() 
    { 
        # assign rx here. 
        goo()
    } 

    void goo() 
    { 
        # save rx here. 
        # use rx 
        # restore rx for foo()
    }
